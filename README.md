## Universe
Repository fetcher and collector of all things BlankBox

# Prerequites

You must have a folder that is used for BlankBox only repositories.

For example:

``~/blankbox/``


This repo should then be child to that:

``~/blankbox/universe/``


All other respositories will be sibling or deeper to this repo.

You can then run the update command to fetch the master of any repos that you have access to.
